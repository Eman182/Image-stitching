Here we stitch images together by
  Getting key points in each image
  Get best matches in images
  Get homography matrix to rotate image to another image
  rotate image to be in same alignment as the other image
  put both images in a big image
  
 if we want to stitch more than 2 images
  we stitch 2 of them then the output with the third one and so on.
